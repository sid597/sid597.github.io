My way to document things I implemented or find interesting for my future self and others.  

Learning a lot from free resources can't match their quality yet, but this is my way of telling what I did and how I did it. Maybe someone can learn from this or help me get better by providing feedback. I know everything I have done can be done in a better way but as a self taught I don't know people whom I can ask for feedback and improve. So I am trying this form of documenting things and let people better than me provide feedback so I can improve and as a result help others improve by providing back.
